# Awesome Claude Skills

Claude Skills are folders with instructions, scripts, and resources that teach Claude specific tasks. Skills can include executable code and are loaded only when needed, allowing you to maintain hundreds without performance impact. Multiple skills can run together for complex tasks like document creation, code testing, and data analysis.

**Note:** This Skills collection were originally created for Claude Code, but have since evolved into the **Agent Skills** open standard adopted by multiple AI coding assistants. This means skills listed here can also be used with Codex, Gemini CLI and other compatible tools. See the table below for paths and documentation.

### What a Basic Skill Looks Like?

```YAML
---
name: api-tester
description: Test REST APIs and validate responses
---

# API Tester

Test HTTP endpoints and validate response structures.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to test API endpoints and verify response data.

## Instructions

When testing an API:

1. Send a request to the specified endpoint
2. Check the response status code
3. Validate the response body structure
4. Report any errors or unexpected results

## Response Validation

- Verify required fields exist
- Check data types match expected values
- Confirm nested objects have correct structure
```

See the [official repo](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) and [creation guide](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12512198-how-to-create-custom-skills) for more details.
